Description
=======

This module calculates either the batting average or home runs per at bat depending
on the input arguments. `-i` and `--player-id` displays the Player ID. `-n` and `--name`
display the player names (first_name last_name). `-g` and `--given-name` also display
the player names (first_name middle_name last_name). `-b` 
states/territories. The number of results returned is dependent on the integer argument provided for `--top-results`. This module works with 
the data set in the `data` directory and calculates similarity based on distribution of the population across the 
provided races.
